#Components that have to be developed

== PolyGame ==
At the beginning we have to provide:
  *a login page
  *a common visual element with the indication of the game phase and the time left

== Players ==
=== Wedge-Study Phase ===
  *The page should display the information, adding more documents and links as the time goes on
  *When the time is over the right values should be shown to the players
  *At the end of this phase the player should produce a poster with the pros and the cons of their wedge

=== Plan-Selection Phase ===
  *We have to provide an interactive table to each team, in order to make them able to create their own mix. The table should show what is going on when a wedge is selected.
  *Users should be able to view the documents produced in the previous page to make their choices
