#summary Components that have to be developed
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Requirements

== PolyGame ==
At the beginning we have to provide:
  * ~~a login page~~
  * a common visual element with the indication of the game phase and the time left

== Players ==
TODO: create the main page for the player
=== Wedge-Study Phase ===
  * ~~The page should display the information, adding more documents and links as the time goes on~~
  * ~~When the time is over the right values should be shown to the players~~
  * ~~At the end of this phase the player should produce a poster with the pros and the cons of their wedge~~
  * ~~Decide what is the format of a poster~~
  * ~~Make the form to input the data (And decide where it is better to store it)~~
  * ~~Allow users to insert just one poster.~~ If there is already a poster the player is asked to edit it and not to insert a new one.

=== Plan-Selection Phase ===
  * We have to provide an interactive table to each team, in order to make them able to create their own mix. The table should show what is going on when a wedge is selected.
  * Users should be able to view the documents produced in the previous page to make their choices

== Game organizer ==
  * ~~Add/remove players with supercool table~~
  * ~~TODO: don't remove players involved in a game!~~
  * FIX: to which game should players be correlated?
  * TODO: it would be nice to be able to see players associated to a game
  * Create a new game
  * Select the users and the wedges that are part of the game
  * They eventually may have to locally edit or create a new wedge
  * They may give some extra time to the players
  * They should have an overview of the state of the game, in order to know whats going on
  * They should create the voters

== Voters ==
  * They have to look at the different solution in order to find the winner of the game
  * In this perspective other parameters should be introduced, to make the decision based on something more than the mere CO2 reduction data. Pareto analysis may come in hand at this point

== Administrator ==
  * He has to setup the system
  * He can edit the global data and add new wedges available in all the games
  * ~~He can create the game organizers~~
