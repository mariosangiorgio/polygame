#summary Components that have to be developed
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Requirements

== PolyGame ==
At the beginning we have to provide:
  * ~~a login page~~
  * ~~a common visual element with the indication of the game phase and the time left~~

== Players ==
~~Create the main page for the player~~
=== Wedge-Study Phase ===
  * ~~The page should display the information, adding more documents and links as the time goes on~~
  * ~~When the time is over the right values should be shown to the players~~
  * ~~At the end of this phase the player should produce a poster with the pros and the cons of their wedge~~
  * ~~Decide what is the format of a poster~~
  * ~~Make the form to input the data (And decide where it is better to store it)~~
  * ~~Allow users to insert just one poster.~~ ~~If there is already a poster the player is asked to edit it and not to insert a new one.~~
  * ~~Users can check their solution with the values provided by the instructors.~~
  * ~~Add a link to come back to the wedge information page~~
  * ~~When the phase one is over the system should take the users to the phase two~~

=== Plan-Selection Phase ===
  * ~~We have to provide an interactive table to each team, in order to make them able to create their own mix. The table should show what is going on when a wedge is selected.~~
  * ~~Users should be able to delete the submitted plan and to create a new one.~~ EXTRA Update instead of drop.
  * ~~Users should be able to view the documents produced in the previous page to make their choices~~

== Game organizer ==
  * ~~TODO: don't remove players involved in a game!~~
  * ~~only one game per organizer (yes, this is not a feature)~~
  * ~~cooooool, now organizers can organize from different computer on different browsers... their session is recreated everytime the organizer.php is loaded up~~
  * ~~see all players in the database~~
  * ~~remove selected players from database~~
  * ~~add players to database~~
  * ~~see players associated to current game~~
  * ~~delete selected players associated to current game~~
  * ~~add incrementally players to current game~~
  * ~~new game created everytime organizer click on "create game"~~
  * ~~organizer page changes depending on the current phase of game~~
  * ~~organizer can make the game start hitting a button~~
  * ~~deleting current game actually deletes all possible games and wedges and game players associated to an organizer: database will be cleaner!!~~
  * ~~organizer.php calculates correctly phase of the game~~
  * ~~organizer.php refreshes in order to show a rudimentary timer~~
  * ~~Select the users and the wedges that are part of the game~~
  * They eventually may have to locally edit or create a new wedge
  * ~~They may give some extra time to the players~~
  * ~~They should have an overview of the state of the game, in order to know whats going on~~
  * ~~They should create, list, delete, choose the voters~~
  * ~~Button "Start phase 1" and "Start phase 2"~~
  * ~~Handle players associated to different phases~~

== Voters ==
  * ~~They have to look at the different solution in order to find the winner of the game~~
  * In this perspective other parameters should be introduced, to make the decision based on something more than the mere CO2 reduction data. Pareto analysis may come in hand at this point

== Administrator ==
  * He has to setup the system
  * He can edit the global data and add new wedges available in all the games
  * ~~He can create the game organizers~~

TODO: Check that all the inputs are validated (For example in newGame)
 * ~~link per tornare indietro dalla pagina delle soluzioni~~
 * ~~aggiungere i dati (section 3) assieme all'introduzione~~
 * ~~pro e cons dai poster~~
 * mostrare conti se la soluzione e' corretta
 * localizzazione wedge
 * ~~20 e' il limite minimo. 20 Deve essere modificabile~~
 * ~~Fix char encoding~~

 * ~~impedire inserimento lettere in creazione gioco~~
 * gestire underscore: non accettarlo in input e metterlo nel db

After Xmas holiday
 * keep an eye on newGroup.php and rulesAndPlayers.php


*For Marko*
 * intro.php has some issues
 * in admin.php when the mouse is over a link it is impossible to read the text. The color of the background is the same than the color of the text.
