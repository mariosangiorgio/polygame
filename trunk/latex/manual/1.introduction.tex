\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is PolyGame}
\emph{Polygame} is a game which aims at making the players aware of the climate crisis and try to make them ponder about possible solution to the excessive CO$_{2}$ emissions.\\
The idea behind this game comes from the work of Robert H. Socolow and Stephen W. Pacala (described in \cite{scientificAmerican} and \cite{science}), which has been slightly revisited by Professors Renato Casagrandi and Giulia Fiorese. They have created a version of the game for the Spring School 2009 (\emph{Global Change and Sustainability}) of Alta Scuola Politecnica.


\subsection{Why PolyGame}
PolyGame aims at making the players aware of the climate crisis and try to engage them through a game which make them ponder about possible solution to the excessive CO$_{2}$ emissions.\\
At the end of the game, players will hopefully not only have a broader knowledge of CO$_{2}$ emission solutions, but will also be aware of the climate crisis.
